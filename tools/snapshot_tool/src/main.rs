//! Standalone source-to-snapshot harness for Spec42.
//!
//! Snapshot Markdown files are the test cases. The runner reads each file's SOURCE section,
//! builds the immutable semantic model, renders each owned derived section, and either reports
//! stale files (`check`) or rewrites them (`update`). It is intentionally a binary rather than a
//! Rust test: review happens through the normal `git diff` of the Markdown files.
//!
//! A fixture may admit the standard library by declaring `libraries=standard` in its META block.
//! The library sources are then admitted as `StandardLibrary`-role documents, so the fixture's
//! references resolve against them while the owned projections keep reporting only the fixture's
//! own authored documents.
