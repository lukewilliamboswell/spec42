//! The semantic authority.
//!
//! The only crate that calls the parser, holds parsed trees ([`syntax`]), lowers and resolves,
//! decides diagnostics, computes library closure ([`library`]), and constructs and publishes a
//! model with its lifecycle ([`publication`]). Parser documents, dense IDs, semantic storage,
//! solver state and indexes stay private; its single dependant is the `sysml_query` facade, and it
//! never reads a file — documents come from the source authority it re-exports as [`source`].
