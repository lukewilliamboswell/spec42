#![recursion_limit = "256"]

//! The facade: the only crate a consumer names for anything SysML.
//!
//! A host obtains one [`Services`] value and works with its handles — [`source::SourceService`],
//! [`syntax::SyntaxService`], [`library::LibraryClosureService`],
//! [`publication::PublicationService`] and [`publication::PublicationSession`] — and with the
//! typed queries of an opaque [`resolved_slice::PublishedModel`]. Parsing, memoisation, file I/O,
//! library closure and publication lifecycle are the authorities' and are invisible behind these
//! handles; consumers cannot obtain a parser tree, the structural graph, resolver state, fact
//! collections, or query-index storage. See `design.md` at the repository root.

/// A host process constructs exactly one of these and hands clones of the handles to whatever
/// needs them; the memo, the library-stratum reuse, and admission policy are then one per process.
